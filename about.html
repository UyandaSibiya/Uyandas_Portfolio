    <p>
      Hey there! I'm Uyanda Sibiya — a passionate coder, a tech enthusiast, and a lifelong learner on a mission to create digital magic.
      From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I was hooked. I love transforming complex ideas into seamless, user-friendly experiences that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I’m building sleek web apps or crafting elegant mobile experiences, I bring creativity, energy, and precision to every project.
      I thrive on challenges, love collaborating with other passionate minds, and am always eager to push the boundaries of what technology can do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open source, or brainstorming my next big idea.
      I believe that the future belongs to those who build it — and I’m ready to build something amazing with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My toolkit includes React, Flutter, Node.js, and more, but my real strength lies in my curiosity and drive to keep growing.
    </p>
